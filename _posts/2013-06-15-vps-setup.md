I recently built a rails app that needed more than the free level provided at Heroku so I decided to provision my own VPS and I thought I’d give the steps I followed to help someone else doing the same thing.

I’m making the following assumptions:
You have a github account and know how to [generate SSH keys].
You can work with a command line editor like vim/emacs/pico
Your using a debian based linux distro on your VPS, I’m using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
If you don’t have a VPS, most people recommend [Linode] since it beats both [EC2] and [Digital Ocean] when [compared head-to-head] but since I was being thrifty and I didn’t need that level of performance, I went with Digital Ocean’s cheapest plan.

Assuming you have your server provisioned, you need to ssh into it, add a user (you don’t need to create a user with the name Sean, but you can) and give the user sudo access.

Setting up the server
{% highlight ruby %}
ssh root@server-ip-address
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
$ adduser sean
Adding user `sean' ...
Adding new group `sean' (1001) ...
Adding new user `sean' (1001) with group `sean' ...
Creating home directory `/home/sean' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for sean
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: Sean
        Room Number []:
        Work Phone []:
        Home Phone []:
        Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y
$
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
$ visudo
{% endhighlight %}

Edit the file so that it looks something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
sean    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
{% endhighlight %}

You should now exit your server and copy your public key to your server, you can copy and paste or just use the scp command. For me the command was:

{% highlight ruby %}
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub sean@server-ip-address:.ssh/authorized_keys
{% endhighlight %}

Now ssh back into your server using your public key. If this doesn’t work, ssh back in using your password you set when you created the account and do the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
{% endhighlight %}

Set the following entries to yes in the sshd_config file:

{% highlight ruby %}
RSAAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes
{% endhighlight %}

After making the change, reload the the ssh configuration file:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo service ssh reload
{% endhighlight %}

Note: if the service command failed run this command:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload
{% endhighlight %}

Exit the server and you should now be able to log in without using a password. Next disable password logins by again editing the sshd_config file and changing the following values to no:

{% highlight ruby %}
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
{% endhighlight %}

Reload the ssh config as before. You should also at this point set up ssh keys on your server and add those keys to your github profile, assuming you are going to be deploying from github. At the top of this article I posted a link to github with their directions on creating ssh keys.

Installing Ruby
We should make sure our system is up to date before installing anything:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get update
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can start with the actual ruby and rails installation. Before we can install rvm we need to install all the rvm dependencies.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion pkg-config
{% endhighlight %}

Then we install RVM

{% highlight ruby %}
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash
{% endhighlight %}

Then reload rvm.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rvm reload
{% endhighlight %}

Then install ruby.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rvm install 2.0.0
{% endhighlight %}

Now install passenger.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rvmsudo gem install passenger
{% endhighlight %}

If you want you can create a gemset for your application. If you are not planning on using your VPS for anything other than hosting this app this is probably not needed. Here is how you do it (my app is called pompeii.)

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rvm gemset create pompeii
{% endhighlight %}

Webserver - Nginx
Now to install Nginx we first need to install the curl development headers with SSL support:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Then install Nginx:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rvmsudo passenger-install-nginx-module
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to configure Nginx for our application vim /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf and in the http section add the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
server {
    client_max_body_size 20M;
    listen       80;
  server_name mydomain.com;
  root /home/sean/pompeii/current/public;  # You'll want to change this to your application name/home directory
  passenger_enabled on;

   location @app {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You don’t strictly need to add the line client_max_body_size 20M; unless you plan on transferring large files to/from your app. Next we need to get the linode init script and make nginx start when the server starts with the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ wget -O init-deb.sh http://library.linode.com/assets/660-init-deb.sh
$ sudo mv init-deb.sh /etc/init.d/nginx
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
$ sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults
{% endhighlight %}

Then just restart Nginx and you are good to go:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
{% endhighlight %}

Database - Postgres
Now on to installing our database. I used Postgresql that you install with the following command:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
{% endhighlight %}

We need to give our application a role and give it the ability to create databases/tables and login.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql   # Enter the postgresql command line
CREATE ROLE sean WITH LOGIN CREATEDB;
\q
{% endhighlight %}

Now just create your database:

{% highlight ruby %}
createdb pompeii -O sean
Deployment - Capistrano
{% endhighlight %}

Now we just need to set up capistrano and we are good to go. Just add the following gems to your gemfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'capistrano'
gem 'rvm-capistrano'
{% endhighlight %}

Then enter the following command from your command line on your development machine: capify . Your Capfile should look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
load 'deploy'
load 'deploy/assets'
load 'config/deploy'
{% endhighlight %}

Your deploy.rb should look something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
require "rvm/capistrano"
require "bundler/capistrano"

set :deploy_to, "/home/sean/pompeii"
set :repository,  "https://github.com/SeanMarcia/pompeii.git"
set :rvm_type, :user
set :rvm_ruby_string, :local
set :use_sudo, false
set :deploy_via, :remote_cache

set :user, "sean"
role :web, "mywebip"
role :app, "mywebip"
role :db,  "mywebip", :primary => true

after "deploy:restart", "deploy:cleanup"
after "deploy", "rvm:trust_rvmrc"

namespace :deploy do
  task :start do ; end
  task :stop do ; end
  task :restart, :roles => :app, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    run "#{try_sudo} touch #{File.join(current_path,'tmp','restart.txt')}"
  end
end

namespace :rvm do
  task :trust_rvmrc do
    run "rvm rvmrc trust #{release_path}"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Assuming you want capistrano to setup and create the directories for you:

{% highlight ruby %}
cap deploy:setup
{% endhighlight %}

Now test to make sure there are no errors with:

{% highlight ruby %}
cap deploy:check
{% endhighlight %}

Use cap deploy:cold the first time you deploy, after that `cap deploy’ is going to be all you need.

{% highlight ruby %}
cap deploy:cold
{% endhighlight %}

Finally migrate your database and you should be good to go.

{% highlight ruby %}
cap deploy:migrate
{% endhighlight %}

This is only a fraction of my deploy script, I have tasks in there to restart solr for search and to precompile my assets to speed up my deployment but this should be enough to get you going. Hopefully your site is now live and on the web!
