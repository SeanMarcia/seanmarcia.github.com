Everyone seems to have a hate on for Rspec recently and a love on for Minitest so I decided to give it a try but it took me forever to get started because I couldn’t find a good reference of necessary matchers and expectations so I decided to list them here for easy access.

{% highlight ruby %}
obj.must_be(operator, expected) - for example, 10.must_be :&lt; , 11
obj.must_be_close_to - the equivalent of assert_in_delta
obj.must_be_empty - Fails unless obj.empty?
obj.must_be_instance_of(klass) - Fails unless obj.class == klass
obj.must_be_kind_of(klass) - Fails unless obj is of class klass or klass is one of its superclasses.
obj.must_be_nil
obj.must_be_same_as - tests for true object equality
lambda {}.must_be_silent
obj.must_be_within_delta
obj.must_be_within_epsilon
obj.must_equal(other) - Does a ==/eql? comparison between two objects.
obj.must_include(other)
obj.must_match(regex) - A regular expression match, e.g. "hello".must_match /w+/
lambda {}.must_output(stdout, [stderr..]) - The block should have certain output on stdout or stderr. Set stdout to nil just to check stderr.
lambda {}.must_raise(exception)
obj.must_respond_to(message)
obj.must_throw(sym)
{% endhighlight %}

There are also, like rspec, negative matchers and expectations. They are:

{% highlight ruby %}
wont_be
wont_be_empty
wont_be_instance_of
wont_be_kind_of
wont_be_nil
wont_be_same_as
wont_equal
wont_include
wont_match
wont_respond_to
{% endhighlight %}

Hope this helps with my TDD. That’s TEST driven development, not Troll driven…
